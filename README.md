## 🌱 Inspiration

Most students don’t lack ambition.  
They lack clarity.

The internet is loud — advice is scattered, generic, and often unrealistic.  
Students are told *“learn everything”* or *“just grind”*, without being shown what actually matters next.

CareerGPS was inspired by one simple question students keep asking:

> **“What should I do right now so I don’t regret it later?”**

Instead of motivation, CareerGPS offers navigation.  
Instead of hype, it provides structure.  
Instead of promises, it gives honest feedback and direction.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

CareerGPS was built with a **systems-first mindset** — every feature connects, nothing exists in isolation.

### Architecture
- Modular design (dashboard, roadmaps, projects, resume analysis)
- Unified global state
- User actions directly influence progress and alignment
- Clean separation of Free and Premium logic

### Frontend
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion** (calm, confidence-building animations)
- Glassmorphism, blur layers, and gradient depth
- Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and laptop

The UI was designed to feel like:

> *“This knows what it’s doing.”*

### AI (Used Responsibly)
- **Gemini API**
- Reads real resumes (PDF/DOCX)
- Parses real job descriptions
- Provides role-aware, practical feedback
- Explains *why* something is weak — not just *that* it is

> AI assists. It does not decide.

### Backend & Services
- **Node.js + Express**
- **Firebase Authentication** (email/password + OAuth)
- **Firestore** for user data
- **EmailJS** for demo premium confirmations
- Secure resume upload handling
- Exportable user data (JSON)
